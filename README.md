# Overview

This program is a very simple Minecraft mod that was created in such a way to help learn how to integrate Java code into an already perfectly functioning world environment. For this mod, I introduced a simple custom Minecraft block, a model written in a JSON file format, and a second Minecraft item that allows the user to fly around wist right-clicking the item in the player's hand.

# Development Environment

The tools and IDE that was used for this program was the IntelliJ environment and an extremely well-made plugin provided by IntelliJ to help easily integrate the Moojane Minecraft engine into the IntelliJ modding environment. 

The libraries that were used were the built-in Mojang libraries and the included libraries provided by IntelliJ for the creation and implementation of the Minecraft Mods
