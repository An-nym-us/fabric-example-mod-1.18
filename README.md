# Overview

This program is a very simple Minecraft mod that was created in such a way to help learn how to integrate Java code into an already perfectly functioning world environment. For this mod, I introduced a simple custom Minecraft block, a model written in a JSON file format, and a second Minecraft item that allows the user to fly around wist right-clicking the item in the player's hand.
